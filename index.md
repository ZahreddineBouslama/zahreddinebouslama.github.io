## Behavioural Real Estate Finance (Europe)

I am Dr. Zahreddine Bouslama, working at the intersection of behavioural finance and real estate economics, with a focus on European housing markets, particularly Luxembourg and neighbouring EU jurisdictions.

My research combines applied econometrics, institutional analysis, and reproducible computational workflows in Python to examine how behavioural biases such as herding and expectation formation interact with market structure, regulation, and systemic risk in illiquid asset classes.

### Current Research

EU HPI Herding (CSAD Framework)

Empirical test of cross-sectional dispersion and herding dynamics using Eurostat House Price Index data (2015–2025).

Status: Working paper in preparation for journal submission.
