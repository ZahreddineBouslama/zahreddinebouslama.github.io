## Behavioural Real Estate Finance (Europe)

I work at the intersection of behavioural finance and real estate economics, focusing on European housing markets — with particular relevance to Luxembourg and neighbouring EU markets. My research combines institutional analysis and econometric modelling with reproducible computational workflows to study how behavioural biases (e.g., herding, expectation formation) interact with market structure and regulation in illiquid asset classes.

### Flagship Reproducible Project

**EU HPI Herding (CSAD)**  
Dispersion-based herding tests using Eurostat House Price Index data (2015–2025).  
Python implementation with full reproducible pipeline:

### Research Interests

- Behavioural biases in real asset markets  
- Housing market integration vs structural segmentation (EU)  
- Macroprudential policy and systemic risk  
- Applied econometrics for illiquid assets  
- Reproducible research infrastructure (Python + GitHub)

### Professional Orientation

Research-informed analysis and educational outputs for real estate professionals and policy-oriented audiences.
