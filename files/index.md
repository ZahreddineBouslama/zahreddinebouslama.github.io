## Behavioural Real Estate Finance (Europe)

I am **Dr. Zahreddine Bouslama**, working at the intersection of **behavioural finance** and **real estate economics**, with a focus on **European housing markets** (Luxembourg and neighbouring markets).

My work combines **econometric modelling**, **institutional analysis**, and **reproducible computational research (Python)** to study how behavioural biases (e.g., herding, expectation formation) interact with market structure and regulation in illiquid asset classes.

## Current focus

- **Herding Behaviour in European Union Housing Markets (2015–2025)**  
  Dispersion-based herding test using the **CSAD** framework and Eurostat HPI data.  
  Replication code: https://github.com/ZahreddineBouslama/eu-hpi-herding-csad

## Research interests

- Behavioural biases in real asset markets  
- Housing market integration vs. structural segmentation (EU)  
- Macroprudential policy and systemic risk transmission  
- Reproducible research pipelines (Python)

## Professional practice

I also produce research-informed analysis and educational outputs for professional audiences in real estate and finance.
