## Research Profile

My work sits at the intersection of behavioural finance and real estate economics, with a regional focus on European housing systems and particular relevance to Luxembourg.

I study how behavioural dynamics, including herding behaviour and expectation formation, interact with institutional structure, regulatory design, and macroprudential frameworks in housing markets. Given the illiquid and locally segmented nature of real estate, these dynamics may differ from those observed in financial securities markets.

Methodologically, my research combines:

- Applied econometric modelling  
- Cross-sectional dispersion frameworks (CSAD)  
- Institutional and regulatory analysis  
- Reproducible computational research in Python  

## Current Working Paper

Herding Behaviour in European Union Housing Markets (2015–2025)

This project applies a dispersion-based methodology to Eurostat House Price Index data to test for nonlinear herding effects across EU member states.

The objective is to evaluate:

- Whether housing markets exhibit behavioural convergence dynamics  
- The degree of structural integration versus segmentation  
- Potential macro-financial stability implications

## Teaching and Academic Interests

I am interested in contributing to teaching in:

- Behavioural Finance  
- Real Estate Economics  
- Applied Econometrics  
- Housing Market Analysis in Europe  
- Reproducible Research Methods  

My teaching approach integrates theoretical foundations with transparent empirical implementation.

## Professional Orientation

In addition to academic research, I develop research-informed analytical outputs and educational materials for professional audiences in real estate and finance.
